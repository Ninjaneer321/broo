            If you want, I can build Mumble from source for you.
            Otherwise I will go the normal package manager route.

            Giving this option because upstream has improved support for
            PipeWire, performance, and bug fixes, and also because distro
            repos are outdated (as of 2022/02/27). I will also install the
            required dependencies.

            1. Install latest stable release. (Recommended)
            2. Install latest master branch. (Not recommended)
            3. Don't build from source.

        - Right click on your user and make sure it is muted.
        - Right click on your user and click on 'Register' to register it.
